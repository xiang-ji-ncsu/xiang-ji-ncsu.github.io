# Welcome!


I am a Postdoc researcher in [Dr. Marc Suchard](http://faculty.biomath.ucla.edu/msuchard/)'s group at UCLA. 

I got my PhD degree in Bio-informatics and Statistics from North Carolina State University under [Dr. Jeff Thorne](http://statgen.ncsu.edu/thorne/)'s direction. 

Before coming to the USA,  I earned my BS degrees in Physics and Economics from Peking University, China. My advisor was [Dr. Jiasen Zhang](http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/~zhangjs/index.html).

I earned my MS degree in Material Science and Engineering at NC State as well. My thesis advisor was [Dr. John Muth](http://www.ece.ncsu.edu/people/muth).
