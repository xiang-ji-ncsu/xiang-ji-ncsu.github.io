# Welcome!


I am a PhD student in Bio-informatics at North Carolina State University. 

Before coming to Bio-informatics I earned my BS degrees in Physics and Economics from Peking University, China.

I earned my MS degree in Material Science and Engineering here at NC State. My thesis adviser was [Dr. John Muth](http://www.ece.ncsu.edu/people/muth). 

I am currently working under [Dr. Jeff Thorne](http://statgen.ncsu.edu/thorne/)'s direction.
