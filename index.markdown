# Welcome!


I am an Assistant Professor in the Math Department at Tulane University.
I work on statistical phylogenetics, from model development to practical parallel computing library implementation.  An old research statement (with some of the items already published) discusses this research direction in more detail in the [Research](./Publication/index.html) tab.

I have been collaborating with my colleague [Dr. Wu-Min Deng](https://medicine.tulane.edu/departments/biochemistry-molecular-biology-deng-lab-tulane-cancer-center-tulane-center-aging/all) at Tulane University on Cancer Biology research.  My role is on the Bioinformatics side.  We are looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students (including future ones) to join the research groups.  Please find more detail in the ad below.
