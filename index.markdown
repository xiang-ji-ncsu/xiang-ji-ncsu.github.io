# Welcome!


I am an Assistant Professor in the Statistics Department at Iowa State University.
I work on statistical phylogenetics, from model development to practical parallel computing library implementation.  A research statement with more detail is in the [Research](./Publication/index.html) tab.  Before coming to ISU, I got my Ph.D. from NC State University, did a postdoc at UCLA and spent 5 years as an Assistant Professor in the Math Department at Tulane University. 

I have been collaborating with [Dr. Wu-Min Deng](https://medicine.tulane.edu/departments/biochemistry-molecular-biology-deng-lab-tulane-cancer-center-tulane-center-aging/all) at Tulane University on Cancer Biology research.  My role is on the Bioinformatics side.
