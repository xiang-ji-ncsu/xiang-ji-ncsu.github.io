I started out research working on Optics.

####Undergraduate Research

**_Plasmonic Lense_** project, Peking University, 2010

Advisor: [Dr. Jiasen Zhang](http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/~zhangjs/index.html), Physics Department, Peking University

The Goal was to design, fabricated, test rectangular shape plasmonic lense composit of nano-scaled slots on a 200nm thin gold film on glass substrate being able to generate sharper focus. This work stays unpublished. 

Due to detection limit, we could not provide direct proof that our device worked by the fact that our image detection system was only sensitive to XY plane (parallel to the device) of the optical field whereas the focus intensity mainly lied in Z direction. If possible, a near field optic probe may detect the focus point and give a direct proof. I show my simulated light intensity distribution at XY plane of the focus point together with experimental result below to give you an idea.

We did have direct proof if we modified the design to have the light field mainly in XY plane, but this one didn't have the property to generate a sharper focus. (Small Numerical Aperture)

**_SPP source_** project, Peking University, 2011

Advisor: Dr. Zhiping Zhou, EECS Department, Peking University

I did my undergraduate thesis in this lab. Part of the work I did was to find a good doping location for SPP source design. The idea was to imbed light source inside a plasmon waveguide. You could find detail in this published [paper](https://github.com/xiang-ji-ncsu/xiang-ji-ncsu.github.io/raw/27914ae129b83c237d03d68fec002646d1163f69/Publication/Effect%20of%20dipole%20location%20on%20profile%20properties%20of%20symmetric%20surface%20plasmon%20polariton%20mode%20in%20Au-Al2O3-Au%20waveguide.pdf) which I co-authored.

####Master Thesis


**_Laser Interference Lithography_** project, NC State University, 2012 - 2013

Advisor: Dr. John Muth, EE Department, NC State University

The goal was to develop a fabrication process using the mask-free laser interference lithography to easily introduce periodic pattern onto devices. We wanted to use it for gas sensor fabrication to increase the surface to volumn ratio which primarily determines gas-sensor's sensitivity. Details can be found in my [ugly-written thesis](https://github.com/xiang-ji-ncsu/xiang-ji-ncsu.github.io/raw/27914ae129b83c237d03d68fec002646d1163f69/Publication/Laser%20Interference%20Lithography%20for%20Fabrication%20of%20Gas%20Sensors.pdf).

Here are some pictures for a taste of what I did.
