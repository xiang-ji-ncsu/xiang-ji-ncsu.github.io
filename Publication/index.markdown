Before joining Bio-informatics program, my research interest mainly lies in the optics in the nano scale. 

It was a lot of fun playing with huge (and expensive) machines, fabricating out devices and actually saw them working!

I started out as an experimental ""physicist" (if only college physics student count...) working in Dr. Jiasen Zhang's lab. I and two other students were on the same grant for undergraduate research. Each of us led his own research project. I worked on designing and fabricating 3 dimensional plasmonic lens with smaller focus point. The lens was only 40 Î¼m in size. And the focal point was out of the metal plane.

I worked at Dr. Zhiping Zhou's lab for my undergraduate thesis. I was working on designing gold/Al2O3/gold waveguide structure for surface plasmonic source. Part of my thesis work was published in this [paper](https://github.com/xiang-ji-ncsu/xiang-ji-ncsu.github.io/raw/27bcd547f21cde5e5731547682fd24029e3277ea/Publication/Effect%20of%20dipole%20location%20on%20profile%20properties%20of%20symmetric%20surface%20plasmon%20polariton%20mode%20in%20Au-Al2O3-Au%20waveguide.pdf).
