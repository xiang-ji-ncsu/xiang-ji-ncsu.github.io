I started out research working on Optics.

####Undergraduate Research

*Plasmonic Lense* project, Peking University, 2010

Advisor: [Dr. Jiasen Zhang](http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/~zhangjs/index.html), Physics Department, Peking University

The Goal was to design, fabricated, test rectangular shape plasmonic lense composit of nano-scaled slots on a 200nm thin gold film on glass substrate being able to generate sharper focus. This work stays unpublished. Due to detection limit, we could not provide direct proof that our device worked by the fact that our image detection system was only sensitive to XY plane (parallel to the device) of the optical field whereas the focus intensity mainly lied in Z direction. If possible, a near field optic probe may detect the focus point and give a direct proof. I show my simulated light intensity distribution at XY plane of the focus point together with experimental result below to give you an idea.

I started out as an experimental ""physicist" (if only college physics student count...) working in Dr. Jiasen Zhang's lab. I and two other students were on the same grant for undergraduate research. Each of us led his own research project. I worked on designing and fabricating 3 dimensional plasmonic lens with smaller focus point. The lens was only 40 Î¼m in size. And the focal point was out of the metal plane.

I worked at Dr. Zhiping Zhou's lab for my undergraduate thesis. I was working on designing gold/Al2O3/gold waveguide structure for surface plasmonic source. Part of my thesis work was published in this [paper](https://github.com/xiang-ji-ncsu/xiang-ji-ncsu.github.io/raw/27bcd547f21cde5e5731547682fd24029e3277ea/Publication/Effect%20of%20dipole%20location%20on%20profile%20properties%20of%20symmetric%20surface%20plasmon%20polariton%20mode%20in%20Au-Al2O3-Au%20waveguide.pdf).
